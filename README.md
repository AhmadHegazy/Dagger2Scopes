Dagger2Scopes
=============
Dagger2Scopes is a sample Android app to implement usual Dagger 1 scoping logic with the brand new Dagger 2 Google lib. In this sample you will be able to find
the following features:

* Multiple scopes with Dagger 2 (Including Application and Activity scopes to provide both contexts).
* An approach to Clean Architecture.
* An approach to MVP pattern.
